<h1>

To be, or not to be, that is the question: <br>

Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer <br>

The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune, <br>

Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, <br>

And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep <br>

No more; and by a sleep, to say we end <br>

The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks <br>

That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation <br>

Devoutly to be wished. To die to sleep, <br>

To sleep, perchance to Dream; Aye, there's the rub, <br>

For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, <br>

When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, <br>

Must give us pause. <br>
